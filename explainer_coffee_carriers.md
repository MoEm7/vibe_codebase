## Problem We Solved
Independent mobile coffee sellers have no easy way to let customers know where they are or what they're selling. Coffee lovers waste time searching for good local coffee with no discovery tool built for mobile vendors. Coffee Carriers solves this by giving makers a live location pin and digital menu, while giving sippers a real-time map to find, pre-order from, and rate nearby coffee carts — no app download required.
